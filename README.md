# Better Now Playing

Better now playing is a *iOS*/*WatchOS* app that was made to replace the Apple's Now Playing app, as they removed the widget on the WatchOS screen. It's the not best working, but it works if you don't count on it working in the background.

## How to use/run
+ Download/Clone this into XCode
+ Run the app on your iOS device
+ Goto the Watch app on your phone, and install the Watch app via the bottom of the app settings.

## What I have learned from Better Now Playing
+ Learned how to use Xcode
+ Learned Swift and a very small bit of C as I was working on Better Now Playing.
+ Learned how to use API documenation more effiantly.
    + Figured out how to use Apple's documentation along with Spotiy's.
    + Learned how to use AI's (like Github's Copilot) to help figure out documention and example code.
